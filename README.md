Leveraging Azure Document Intelligence (formerly Azure Form Recognizer), I trained a custom model to extract relevant fields such as bill date, total consumption, KVA demand, and payment deadlines.
Utility Bill Information Extraction with Azure Document Intelligence
Description:
This project demonstrates a custom solution for extracting structured data from utility company bills to facilitate detailed analytics reporting. Leveraging Azure Document Intelligence (formerly Azure Form Recognizer), I trained a custom model to extract relevant fields such as bill date, total consumption, KVA demand, and payment deadlines from complex and variable bill formats.

Key Features:
Custom Model Training: Utilized Azure Document Intelligence to train a model tailored for utility bill data extraction.
Python Integration: Built a Python pipeline for preprocessing input data, interfacing with Azure APIs, and formatting extracted information for analysis.
Scalable Analytics: Extracted data feeds into a structured format, enabling generation of comprehensive analytics reports.
Adaptable Design: The solution is flexible enough to accommodate variations in bill formats from different utility providers.
Technology Stack:
Azure AI Services: Azure Document Intelligence for model training and inference.
Python: For script development, API integration, and data handling.
Use Case:
This project is designed for organizations or individuals looking to automate the extraction of utility bill data to streamline workflows, reduce manual data entry, and gain actionable insights through analytics.
